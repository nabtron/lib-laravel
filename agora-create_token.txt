1. we can't add the library to vendor directory, as namespace didn't work for me (as of now)

2. create a new directory in app folder, call it vendor or ThirdParty etc. Note that naming it 3rd party won't work, don't start foldername with a number, and copy the agora files in it.
note that app directory starts with small a, but we will call it App with capital A in namespace

3. goto the agora library files and add namespace on top of two files:

namespace App\ThirdParty\agora\agora_token;
