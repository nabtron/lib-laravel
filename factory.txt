factory with tinker gives error in laravel 8, such as: 

>>> factory(App\Cls\ClassName,5)000)->create()
PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function factory() in Psy Shell code on line 1
(this error is due to changes in laravel 8, this method will not work now)

or
>>> ClassName::factory()->count(1000)->create()
PHP Error:  Class "ClassName" not found in /Users/username/Local Siteseval()'d code on line 1

The errors are due to incomplete path in classname, add complete path like: 
>>> App\Models\ClassName::factory()->count(1000)->create()
